        Find the line that starts with linux then add modprobe.blacklist=nouveau after quiet splash.
    Choose a Wifi Network and install third party software and updates
    Once the installation is done, remove the pendrive and reboot system

    Select Ubuntu at GRUB (you may need to repeat the modprobe.blacklist=nouveau step if the screen freezes again).
